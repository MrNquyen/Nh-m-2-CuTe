                  This innovative method, as the name implies, processes the entire image in a 
                  single go to detect objects and their location. YOLO's approach differs from 
                  traditional two-stage detection methods by treating object detection as a 
                  regression problem. It uses a single convolutional neural network to 
                  simultaneously predict bounding boxes and classification probabilities across 
                  the entire image, simplifying the detection process compared to more complex
